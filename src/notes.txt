for youtube dependencies:
npm i react-youtube: pass video id and it will run the player
for searching YT trailer:
npm i --save movie-trailer : pass movie name and it will return the url for trailer > now we will have to extract the YT vid id > pass to above fn.

Note: movie-trailer didnot work, so had to use TMDB api for vid trailer
